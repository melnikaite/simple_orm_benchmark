Introduction
------------

simple_orm_benchmarker is a simple script to benchmark ruby ORMs.  It
currently supports ActiveRecord and Sequel.

Configuration
-------------

To use this, you first need to copy db.yml.example to db.yml, and modify it
accordingly.

Usage
-----

Then you can run the benchmarking via:

  ruby simple_orm_benchmark.rb -a
  ruby simple_orm_benchmark.rb sequel-postgresql
  ruby simple_orm_benchmark.rb -l 4 activerecord-mysql
  ruby simple_orm_benchmark.rb -l 6 -g activerecord-sqlite sequel-sqlite

Options:

* -a will test all configurations in the db.yml configuration file.
* -l is the testing level.  It's designed to be logrithmic, with a level 6
  test taking about twice as long as a level 5.  The default level is 5.
* -g will disable garbage collection during the test, to measure the amount
  of garbage the test generates.

You can list one or more configurations to test as arguments.  The
arguments should match keys in the hash parsed from the yaml file.

The output of the benchmark is in CSV, with columns in the following order:

configuration_name: Name of configuration
level: Testing level
benchmark_name: Name of benchmark
user_cpu_time: Amount of user CPU time
system_cpu_time: Amount of system CPU time
total_cpu_time: Amount of total CPU time
elapsed_real_time: Amount of actual/real/wallclock time
kb_of_memory_used: Difference in process memory usage from the benchmark
transaction_used: Whether a transaction was used

Most tests are run both inside of and outside of a transaction, so you get
results both ways.

Reporting
---------

For easier comparison of different configurations, you can use the
results_aggregator.rb script:

  ruby ./simple_orm_benchmark.rb sequel-sqlite activerecord-sqlite > r.txt
  ruby ./results_aggregator.rb r.txt > r.csv

That will output CSV, with columns in the following order:

activerecord-sqlite_real_time
sequel-sqlite_real_time
benchmark_name_with_transaction

Using this you can see comparitive results easily, not just for different
ORMs, but also for different databases with the same ORM.
